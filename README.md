# Hi there! 👋

I'm Timo, a passionate Fullstack Developer from Obermarsberg, Germany. My fascination with technology began in school, where I completed my high school diploma in Electrical Engineering. This led me to start studying Technical Computer Science after school. Currently doing a further education as a Web Developer at [DCI](https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/de/courses/web-development).

## Current Projects 🚀
- In the midst of my final project at [CodeTriumvirat](https://github.com/orgs/CodeTriumvirat/repositories). We are working with a NextJS frontend and a VPS at Hetzner, where we host our BaaS and some other services. 
- On a personal note, I've started building my own website using Astro. It's intended to be a personal space on the web where I can write some blogs and how-tos whenever i feel like it.

## My Tech Stack 🛠
- **Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, (rusty with Assembler, C and Python)
